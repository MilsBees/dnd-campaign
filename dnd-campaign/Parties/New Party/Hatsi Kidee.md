## Backstory
Hatsi Kidee was born to a poor family in the woods outside of civilization. She grew up running wild in the forest, climbing trees and catching fish in the streams. She was always impulsive and loved her freedom, but she also had a knack for taking things apart and putting them back together again. When she was old enough, she left home to find her own adventure. She quickly learned that the world was not as simple as she thought it was. She made her way as a thief and a con artist, using her skills to survive. She was always on the move, never staying in one place for long. She would have been happy to live out her life this way, but fate had other plans. One day, she was caught in the middle of a battle between a group of bandits and a group of Woodland elves. The elves were outnumbered and outmatched, and Hatsi found herself fighting alongside them. She quickly realized that she loved the feeling of fighting for something, of being part of something larger than herself. After the battle, the elves invited her to join their cause. They were fighting against a group of humans who were trying to destroy the forest. Hatsi didn't hesitate to join them.
