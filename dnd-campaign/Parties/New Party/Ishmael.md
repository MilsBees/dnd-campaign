## Backstory
My name is Ishmael, I am a monk from the far reaches of Asrael. I was born of noble family yet I did not have the richness of a careless upbringing. At early age my late father, luitenant of the 3rd division, committed treason by deserting his army in a hopeless battle and was in return given an early death. My mother sent me and my brother away to serve at a nearby temple for the god Breyting. Our temple as well as our god is unknown to many, just as our practice is different to that of other monks in this country. Instead of stability we seek to break pattern, instead of closing ourselves of from the world we influence the great powers at play. We are not the followers of change, we are the shapers. 

Although there are no ranks in our order, I have commanded the respect of my fellows by my ambition and purpose.
My limitless belief in our god has led me to stand back up from any harship this world has sent my way.
I seem to always be there where important events happen. And so I have found myself here.
