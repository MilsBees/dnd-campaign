## Backstory
I was born in Romaro, a large city ruled by a lord. My parents were servants for that lord, but they were well treated by their lord Drake. I did not have much as a son of servants, but I was always well fed and warm. By not having much I learned how much my family and friends meant to me. But my life quickly changed.....

One day I was playing outside the courtyard of the castle. I was playing with my toys. My most special toy was a wooden horse carved by my dad. I loved that horse and took it everywhere. While I was playing a girl came to me. She was the lord's daughter Amalia. She asked me if she could play with my horse, but I did not want to share it, so I refused. She became angry and ran inside the house.

A few moments later guards came out of the castle. They grabbed my and put me in chains. They said that I had stolen a wooden horse from the princess and they put me in jail.

For my actions  my family was banished from the kingdom and I never saw them again after that day. I then vowed that I would train to be the best thief in the world and that one day I would steal everything that bitch of a lord's daughter ever owned!

This vow made me follow the dark path but sometimes I will do good if something reminds me of my family.
