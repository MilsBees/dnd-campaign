# Euphemia Tealeaf
## Description
Tealeaf is a halfling bard with tan skin and hazel eyes. She has wavy, brown hair. 

## Personality Traits
Euphemia Tealeaf, also known as simply Tealeaf, is a Fey creature that has seen hatred slowly make her stronger over the years. When she was young, [[Jymefreigh]] killed her family by accident whilst practicing his magic in the Feywild. He wasn't a strong magic practitioner and thus didn't have control. She has a fascination with ears and has been collecting them in a bucket. Learning of [[Jymefreigh]]'s actions drew her further into darkness and she's become more evil over time. 

## Background
Tealeaf is a former member of [[Ruin]] that left to pursue a life in the Thieves' Guild known as [[The Family]]. As part of her initiation she had to steal a potion from [[Rugo]]. The potion she drank brought her into the Feywild, where she lived as part of the [[Unseelie Court]]. The people of the Unseelie Court showed her that [[Jymefreigh]] was the one responsible for the death of her parents and granted her great powers so she could avenge them.
