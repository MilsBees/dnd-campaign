# LeBard von Bard de Bard
## Description
LeBard is a half-elf Bard that has neon green hair and is very pale. 

## Facts
Born: [[Rapla]]
Mother: [[Adine von Bard]]
Father: [[Feno de Bard]]

## Backstory
Both of LeBard's parents were bards, though his mother was more talented than his father. His mother was born in [[Rapla]] like LeBard himself. His father was originally from [[Walinley]]. They were the founders of the two colleges in [[Swanband]]. When LeBard was young, his parents were killed by bandits and LeBard wants revenge, despite his fearful nature.

LeBard spent time at both of his parents colleges, but he was more like his father and swayed towards the [[Bard College of Lore]] as opposed to the [[Bard College of Valor]].

LeBard has a letter in his possession from his late colleague and brother, [[LeBeedle von Bard de Bard]]. The letter reads:

	"LeBard, my dear brother,
	
	In the shadows of our shared past, a tragedy befell our family. The cold hands of fate claimed our parents, stolen away by the cruel actions of heartless bandits. Their memory haunts our every step, seeking justice and closure.
	
	Yet, as we ventured together, a lingering question arose, forever etched in my mind. It speaks of secrets untold and hidden truths.
	
	The question is this: 'Who pulled the strings that wove the web of our family's demise?'
	
	For years, you have sought vengeance without knowing the true orchestrators of that fateful event. Now, as I pen these words from the great beyond, I pass this enigma to you, hoping it guides you toward the answers we seek.
	
	Unravel the tangled threads of fate, LeBard, and may your pursuit bring forth the justice and closure our family deserves.
	
	With eternal love and unwavering kinship,
	
	LeBeedle"

## DM Notes
The bandits that killed LeBard's parents were hired by [[Adald Lacey]] and [[Brulnia Fitch]], as they wanted control of the Colleges. 

LeBard has a letter from a dead former colleague in his possession, which poses a question he doesn't know the answer to.
