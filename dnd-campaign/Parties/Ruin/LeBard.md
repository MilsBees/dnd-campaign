# LeBard Von Bard de Bard
## Description
LeBard is a half-elf Bard that has neon green hair and is very pale. 

## Facts
Born: [[Rapla]]
Mother: [[Adine Von Bard]]
Father: [[Feno de Bard]]

## Backstory
Both of LeBard's parents were bards, though his mother was more talented than his father. His mother was born in [[Rapla]] like LeBard himself. His father was originally from [[Walinley]]. They were the founders of the two colleges in [[Swanband]]. When LeBard was young, his parents were killed by bandits and LeBard wants revenge, despite his fearful nature.

LeBard spent time at both of his parents colleges, but he was more like his father and swayed towards the [[Bard College of Lore]] as opposed to the [[Bard College of Valor]].

## DM Notes
The bandits that killed LeBard's parents were hired by [[Adald Lacey]] and [[Brulnia Fitch]], as they wanted control of the Colleges.
