## Facts
Born: [[Grambe]]
Mother: [[Tisha O Freighjymb]] 
Father: [[Ailas O Freighjymb]]

## Backstory
Jyme is from a white picket fence elven society. His father Ailas ran a lute shop, whilst his mother Tisha was renowned seamstress. 

When he was old enough he left for Dizzle University. There he discovered that traditional thoughts on government didn't seem to make sense and he became enamored with the ideas of a free market economy. He dropped out of university shortly after meeting [[Alisa Rosenbaum]]. Alisa taught him how to steal and sneak, whilst also sharing her ideas of libertarianism.

At a certain point though, Jyme decided to go his own way. Jyme met Q when Q saved him from some thugs after Jyme tried to steal from them. 

## DM Notes
Alisa Rosenbaum is secretly the Royal Python.
