Ruin is an adventuring party consisting of [[LeBard]], [[George]], [[Q'Ulrunteor]] and [[Jymefreigh]]. Ruin originally gained fame by helping [[Queen Daelia]] to the throne in the [[Battle of the Throne Room]]. This was before [[LeBard]] joined the party and when they were still aided by [[Euphemia Tealeaf]], who disappeared shortly afterwards.

Since rising to fame, Ruin was tasked with finding the missing wizard [[Azuvira]] by [[Raszu]] and [[Koren Helder]].
