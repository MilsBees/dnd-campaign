# George
## Description
George is a Tiefling Warlock/Sorcerer that has dark blue skin, black eyes and black hair.   

## Facts
Born: [[Portelis]]
Mother: [[Nuleth]] 
Father: [[Mordai]]

## Backstory
Since early in his childhood, George has been accompanied by a fiend he believes to be his father, because his mother said his father was a fiend. George is charismatic outsider who tries to do good, until the fiend comes along. As his father left before George was born, he grew up in the care of Nuleth. 

George has a pseudodragon familiar named Percival. 

His mother is an Aberrant Mind sorcerer, something which he recently learned. Awakening these skills within him were accelerated by pulling from the [[Deck of Many Things]] in the [[Hither]] cottage belonging to [[Bavlorna Blightstraw]]. In that same sequence, he came into possession of the [[Red Orb of Dragonkind]].

## DM Notes
The fiend patron of George is called [[Gargauth]], also known as The Exile. He was a former Treasurer of Hell, a demigod of betrayal and political corruption. 

George is unaware that his father is actually just another tiefling called Mordai who left Nuleth when she became pregnant. He currently lives in [[Oakheart]].
