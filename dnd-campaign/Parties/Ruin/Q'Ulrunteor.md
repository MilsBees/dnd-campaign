# Q'Ulrunteor
## Description
Q is a hairless black dragonborn weretiger barbarian with black scales and red eyes.  

## Facts
Born: [[Linxakasendalor]]
Mother: [[Akra]]
Father: [[Arjhan]]

## Backstory
After an unsuccessful night out looking for companionship, Q returned home drunk. All he wanted was to retreat to his room and sleep off the impending hangover, but his mother stops him and asks him what's wrong. He doesn't answer and goes upstairs, pursued by his mother. In frustration, he pushes her and she falls to her death at the bottom of the stairs. This wakes his father up, who comes out of the room and shakes Q, who beats him to death. 

As a result, Q was banished from his village. Q used to be a disciple of [[Tiamat]], but started following [[Avandra]] following his banishment.

Q met [[Jymefreigh]] on a drunken night, where he ended up protecting Jymefreigh after Jymefreigh had stolen something. 

Q has a dark side and is constantly fighting those bad urges. Q fights very hard to keep these urges at bay, but they explode out of him when he's raging. 

In a fight with [[Yellow Cobra]] earlier in the campaign, Q was afflicted with a lycanthropic curse and is now a weretiger. 

Since becoming a weretiger, Q has recurring dreams where he relives the night he killed his parents. 

## DM Notes
This backstory is a false memory implanted via Modify Memory by his uncle [[Resken]]. Resken did this at the behest of [[Tiamat]], who was being punished by [[Bane]]. 

The more Q transforms into a weretiger, the more those features become permanent. His whiskers will stay and grow longer with each transformation and his scales will yellow in places to form the stripes. These also become more pronounced each transformation, as is also the case with this teeth.
