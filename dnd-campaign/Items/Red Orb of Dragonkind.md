For most of the info, see D&D Beyond. To hide some info from the players, here are the hidden characteristics:

While attuned to an orb, you can use an action to peer into the orb’s depths and speak its command word. You must then make a DC 20 Charisma saving throw. On a successful check, you control the orb for as long as you remain attuned to it. On a failed check, you become [condition]charmed[/condition] by the orb for as long as you remain attuned to it.

While you are charmed by the orb, you can’t voluntarily end your attunement to it, and the orb casts [spell]suggestion[/spell] on you at will (save DC 18), urging you to work toward the evil ends it desires. The dragon essence within the orb might want many things: the annihilation of a particular people, freedom from the orb, to spread suffering in the world, to advance the worship of Tiamat, or something else the GM decides.

#### Destroying an Orb

An _Orb of Dragonkind_ appears fragile but is impervious to most damage, including the attacks and breath weapons of dragons. A [spell]disintegrate[/spell] spell or one good hit from a +3 magic weapon is sufficient to destroy an orb, however.

-   Each time you attune to this artifact, you lose 10lbs permanently
-   When you attune to this artifact, your constitution score is reduced by 2. A greater restoration spell restores this ability to normal.
