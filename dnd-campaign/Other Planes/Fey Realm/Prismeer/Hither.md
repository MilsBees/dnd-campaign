# Overview
Hither is a portion in the heart of Prismeer that currenly is an enormous swamp of mangrove roots. The hag [[Bavlorna Blightstraw]] has made her lair here after trapping the archfey [[Zybilna]] together with the other hags of the [[Hourglass Coven]].

## History
The Brokenstone Vale used to be a part of the [[Seelie Court]], but when lycanthropes began to settle here, it was slowly abandoned and is now neutral territory. This after a long war between the eladrin elves and the lycanthropes. Now there's a mutual agreement to stay out of each other's territories. 

## Notable Places
### Wererat cave
Whilst in the general settlement there are some shacks and other structures that house the various lycanthropes, the wererats tend to dwell in the cave. The other lycanthropes don't really venture in here out of respect...and fear. There are just too many of them.
