# Overview
The Brokenstone Vale is valley in the Feywild that is home to a civilization of lycanthropes. The leader of these lycanthropes is [[Viktor Mazan]]. Towering over the valley is mountain the curves down onto itself like a bent finger, which casts shade over the town. The settlement Viktor set up is known as [[Shatterstone]].

Getting here is easiest from the [[Feywild Entrances| Feywild Entrance]] in [[Walinley]]. Lycanthropes settled here because they could be away from civilization here safely. As access from the Material Plane was only possible on a full moon, it was the perfect getaway. Some stay only for when they're transformed, others settle down entirely. 

Most inhabitants are mistrustful of visitors and will try to get rid of them as soon as possible, though some are allowed to stay for a short time if they bring something worthy of trade.

Overlooking the Brokenstone Vale is a massive mountain known as [[Curly Peak]], which curves back in on itself. The apex of the mountain points downwards instead of up, but somehow still holds snow. 

## History
The Brokenstone Vale used to be a part of the [[Hither]], but when lycanthropes began to settle here, it was slowly abandoned and is now neutral territory. This after a long war between the bullwugs and the lycanthropes. Now there's a mutual agreement to stay out of each other's territories. 

## Notable Places
### Wererat cave
Whilst in the general settlement there are some shacks and other structures that house the various lycanthropes, the wererats tend to dwell in the cave. The other lycanthropes don't really venture in here out of respect...and fear. There are just too many of them.
