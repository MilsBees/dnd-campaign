# Overview
The Fey realm is a timeless, forgotten place that does as it pleases. It's the realm of dreams, emotion and paradox. 

## Entrances

### Halfling library in [[Wihutash]]
Reading a book from the 'Tales of Elanin' book series makes one enter a trance for a short time, after which the reader finds themselves in the Feywild. 

### Pond on the outskirts of [[Walinley]]
The riddle 'Enter through the moon' is the key to the entrance here. On a full moon night, wading into the water and standing on the reflection of the moon on the water's surface gets one into the Feywild. When taking this entrance, you end up at the top of the valley looking down into the [[Brokenstone Vale]]. 

> At first you hear nothing. You see only a river flowing rapidly down in a valley below, as you stand on the precipice of the cliff that looks down into it. A moment later, the world erupts into vibrant life and for a second you're overwhelmed by the beauty of it and swept up in emotion. Birds sing and crickets chirp from the forest behind you and to your left you see the cliff slopes gently down into the valley.  The moonlight reflects onto flowers surrounding you and they seem to glow in the dark in slivers, blues and violets. Fireflies seem to be everywhere and they light your way. Looking down into the valley you see some structures in the distance. You also hear a multitude of howls in the distance coming from below.
