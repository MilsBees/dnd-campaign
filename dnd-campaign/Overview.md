To those who can hear me, I say, do not despair
The misery that is now upon us is but the passing of greed
The bitterness of bullywugs who fear the way of bullywug progress
The hate of those bullywugs will pass, and witches die
And the power they took from us bullywugs will return to the bullywugs
And so long as bullywugs die, liberty will never perish
Don't give yourselves to these unnatural frogs
Machine frogs with machine minds and machine hearts!
You are not machines, you are not cattle, you are bullywugs!
You, the bullywugs, have the power to make this life free and beautiful
To make this life a wonderful adventure
Let us use that power!
Let us all unite!
