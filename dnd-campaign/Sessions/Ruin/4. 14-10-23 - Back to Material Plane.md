## Summary of previous session
The fight with [[Dailili]] continued. 

[[Azuvira]] took some heavy hits early and party members had to fight through entanglement after being pulled from the sky. Still, [[Q'Ulrunteor]] managed to strike the final blow in the end and the Fey realm and the Material Plane were safe once more.

[[Zybilna]] promised to reduce the time lost in returning from the Feywild as they set to return to the Material Plane with [[Zybilna]] being urgently called back by [[Raszu]].
