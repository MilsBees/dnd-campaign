## Summary of previous session
After finally having found [[Azuvira]], the session started with a discussion of the plans ahead. [[Azuvira]] would take [[Doric]] to [[Yon]] in order to stop [[Endelyn Moongrave]], whilst [[Ruin]] would themselves take down [[Skabatha Nightshade]]. This all so that they could free [[Zybilna]] and stop the [[Hourglass Coven]] once and for all. In addition, [[Azuvira]] had warned them of the grave threat that [[Dailili]] posed to both the Feywild as well as the Material Plane. 

Upon defeating [[Skabatha Nightshade]], the party was ambushed by [[Euphemia Tealeaf]] who was out to kill [[Jymefreigh]]. 

## Plans for the session
The party can choose the fight [[Dailili]] first or to free [[Zybilna]] before fighting [[Dailili]].

In approaching [[Dailili]] they notice a withering forest. Any attempts to grow or heal plant life in the area are met with failure, as [[Dailili]]'s sinister influence stifles nature's ability to thrive.

## Notes & Descriptions
### Lead up to the lair
The path leading to the lair is marked by twisted trees and shrivelled foliage, their vibrant colours faded to shades of sickly grey and desolate brown. The ground is littered with dry, lifeless leaves that crunch beneath their feet, a haunting echo of the once-lively forest floor.

The air carries a heavy scent of decay and the oppressive silence is broken only by the mournful groans of ancient trees, as if they weep for their stolen vitality. 

The further into the forest you go, the more pronounced the signs of blight become, the life force of the forest visibly draining away. Birds have abandoned their nests, and once-playful animals cower in fear, their spirits broken by the malevolence that now pervades the woods. As the adventurers near the entrance to the underground lair, a chilling feeling of foreboding sets in.
