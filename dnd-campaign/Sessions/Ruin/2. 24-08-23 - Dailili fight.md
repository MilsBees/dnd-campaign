## Summary of previous session
[[Ruin]] decided it would be best to free [[Zybilna]] before heading off to fight [[Dailili]]. They performed the ritual needed to free her and spent some time strategizing with [[Zybilna]] and [[Azuvira]] about how to proceed in fighting [[Dailili]]. In the end, they decided to retrieve a hot air balloon so they could assault from the air as well as the ground. 

## Plans for the session
