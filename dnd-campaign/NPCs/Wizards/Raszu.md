# Raszu
## Description
Raszu is a wood elf wizard with long silvery hair down to his shoulders. He often stands with his fingertips touching on each hand. In most situations, Raszu has a smirk on his face. 

## Personality Traits
Raszu is a master of illusion and will often take on the form of Jacksonville, a small human boy. He speaks with a very strange tempo, often starting sentences slow before finishing quickly, as if he doesn't know what he's going to say when he starts a sentence, only committing to his words halfway through what he's saying.

Whilst Raszu is generally very playful and a bit naughty, he's very patriotic under the surface and will do everything for the good of Elanin. Whenever he's seen, it's never certain if he's really there or not as he loves to use Project Image to make it seem as though he's somewhere even though he sits in the comfort of his own tower.

## Background
Raszu is Elanin's foremost expert on the school of Illusion. Based in Dellvin, where he has a tower on the outskirts of town. 

He's one of the five great wizards of the realm who brought magic back to Elanin after the Great Loss. Nowadays he serves as the Arcanist of Civil Influence.
