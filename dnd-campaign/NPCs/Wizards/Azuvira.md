# Azuvira
## Description
Azuvira is a high elf wizard. She has reddish blond hair that's braided into a long sharp point in the shape of a cone. She's slender and tall with a hooked nose and high cheekbones.

## Personality Traits
She is a serious character, though the Feywild has rubbed off on her. She therefore acts on impulse a lot of the time. She's very goal oriented and is very focused on keeping the realms separate, as she knows what a catastrophe it could bring if realms were to become too closely connected. 

## Background
Azuvira is one of the five great wizards who brought magic back to Elanin after [[The Great Loss]]. She's trying to stop the [[Tree of Infinity]] from influencing the Material Plane, a fact she only discovered when she got to the Feywild. Originally she was trying to master the Plane Shift spell, a spell she invented for those who do not innately have that ability. 

Ruin will find her in the forest on the way to meeting [[Lamorna]] at the [[Wayward Pool]].
