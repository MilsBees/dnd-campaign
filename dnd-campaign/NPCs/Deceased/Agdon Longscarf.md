# Agdon Longscarf
## Description
Agdon Longscarf is a harengon male with long perky ears. Agdon's scarf is a bright blue length of cloth that was woven from lightning bolts. The scarf cannot be removed, even upon Agdon's death. The branding iron ceases to function outside the Fey Realm. The brand makes a brand in the shape of three bounding rabbits connected nose to tail, forming a triangle. 

## Personality Traits
Agdon is very self-centered and self-confident. This is exarcebated by the fact that there are songs sung about him all day long. 

## Background
Agdon Longscarf has greatly benefited from the takeover of the [[Hourglass Coven]]. [[Zybilna]] had punished Agdon for previous wrongdoing and had him tied permanently to the tree stump that lies at the center of the Brigand's Tollway. [[Bavlorna Blightstraw]] freed him if he would steal from everyone he came across.
