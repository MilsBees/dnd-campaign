# Irlax (deceased)
## Description
Irlax is an adult black dragon with long horns that extend from the top of its head down to protect its face. The horns grow from black near the base to skeletal and white near the tips. It has large black scales all over its body, though near its horns, cheekbones and eyes the scales have discoloured through which you can see its hide like skin. 

Besides the two large horns on the top of its head, the rest of his body is spiked as well, though these are smaller and more rounded. Its tongue is long, flat and forked near the end, which it flicks out every few seconds. 

One of its wings seems to be damaged and is kept close to its body. This means it cannot fly.

Irlax is the son of [[Uldrain - The Dark]], the ancient black dragon that resides near the Dragonborn lands.

## Personality Traits
Irlax is a bitter and angry dragon that has been tending its wounds in its lair since its losing battle with [[Vozanth - The Gentle]], the ancient copper dragon living near [[Watesyndr]]. 

Irlax is particularly cruel. He will offer the party a chance to leave with their lives, though he will try to block their escape if they try to leave. 

Irlax will size up the party and identify its weakest member and target it first. It will try and play with its food first, but will become angry if it realizes the battle is harder than first thought.

## Actions
If the party flees, Irlax will follow them for a bit, but is still hesitant to leave the lair in his injured state. 

> Hahahahahaha! The arrogance and the stupidity of mankind never ceases to astound me. 

> Leaving so soon? Why not stay a while? 

> Come back here!

> Did Vozanth send you to finish the job?


## Stat Block
**Armor Class**: 19

### Lair
[[Irlax lair.jpeg]]

The lair smells of rot and decaying flesh and you can see many half eaten carcasses of dead animals slowly dissolving in the pools of acid that make up most of the lair. There are three man-made bridges that lead to the altar where Irlax lies surrounded by its hoard. If Irlax moves from his lying place, it will reveal an altar to the [[Wildmother]].

**Lair Actions** (can't use the same one twice in a row)
- Pools of water that the dragon can see within 120 feet of it surge outward in a grasping tide. Any creature within 20 ft of such a pool must succeed on a STR 15 Saving Throw or be pulled 10 feet into the water and knocked prone. 
- A swarm of insects descend from the walls and create a 20 foot sphere which spreads around corners. The area is lightly obscured and creatures in the sphere must make a CON 15 Saving Throw, taking 3d6 piercing damage on a fail or half as much on a success. Ending the turn in the cloud you also take 3d6 piercing damage. 
- Magical darkness spreads from a point the dragon chooses within 60 feet of it, which fills a 15 foot radius. The darkness stays until this ability is used again, the dragon dismisses it as an action or the dragon dies. Darkvision can't see through it and non-magical light can't illuminate it. If any of the effect's area overlaps with an area of light created by a spell of 2nd level or lower, the spell that created the light is dispelled.
