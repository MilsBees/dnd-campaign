# Theodas Olowenys

## Description
Theodas is a male elf with brown hair and high cheekbones. His son [[Erolith Olowenys]] looks a lot like him. 
  
## Personality Traits
Theodas is an enthusiastic and energetic man. He has a real passion for making potions which he has tried in vain to pass along to his son. He is a big fan of [[Rugo]]'s work and was disappointed to hear of his death as he'd always wanted to go to [[Greelin]] to get some tricks of the trade. 

He's very pleased that [[Jymefreigh]] is an adventurer and is looking forward to the prospect of making potions specifically for him. 

## Background
Theodas is married to [[Lenna Olowenys]] and he runs the Conjured Refreshment potion shop in [[Walinley]].
