# Nuleth
## Description
 Nuleth is a tall high elf with bronze skin with traces of blue and long golden red hair tied in a braid over her right shoulder. 
 
## Personality Traits
She loves [[George]] more than anything and will protect him at all costs. Now he's away she hopes he's doing okay and waits at home hoping he'll return in one piece. While he's away, she tries to find any and all information about him and she keeps clippings from newspapers or anything she can find on George. She's afraid for him but also very proud of all he's achieved so far.

Nuleth often touches the back of her neck and tucks something into her hair. To most this seems like she's just tucking stray hairs back into her hair, but she really does this because she believes she has a tentacle that sticks out the back of her head which she must hide. Nobody else can see this however. She also thumbs the pendant on her neck often, so she's almost never sitting still. 

## Background
She raised George by herself, always hoping secretly he wouldn't leave the way her husband did, but understanding nonetheless. She knew George talked to the [[Gargauth]]. Although she knew he may be some nefarious creature, she was just glad he had a friend and didn't want to take that away from George as well in addition to not having a father. That's also the reason she never corrected George when he said [[Gargauth]] was his father. 

Nuleth has some innate magical abilities she tried to keep hidden from George because she knows the world is a dangerous place and didn't wish that for her son. [[Gargauth]] is aware of this however. She always wears a pendant on her neck, which serves as her arcane focus.
