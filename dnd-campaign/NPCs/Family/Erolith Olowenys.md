# Erolith Olowenys
## Description
Erolith is a male elf with shoulder length brown hair and high cheekbones. 
  
## Personality Traits
Erolith is a brooding teenage elf who wants to leave Walinley and become an adventurer, but he has no real skills. He's looks up to [[Jymefreigh]] and hangs on his every word. He's therefore deeply susceptible to Jyme's preaching on libertarianism. 

## Background
Erolith and Jymefreigh used to play together as children when [[Tisha O Freighjymb]] would bring her son to [[Walinley]] on family visits every other summer.

Jymefreigh gave him 50 gold to start his shroom business.
