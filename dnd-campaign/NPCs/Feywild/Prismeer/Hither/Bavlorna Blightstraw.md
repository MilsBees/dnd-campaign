# Bavlorna Blightstraw
## Description
Bavlorna Blightstraw is a dark grey coloured hag with straw for hair and large round eyes that seem to pop out of her head. She has teeth that are yellowed and seemingly sharpened roughly. Her mouth can open to swallow up to Medium creatures. 

## Personality Traits
Bavlorna is almost part frog and speaks in a croaking voice. Bavlorna will remove the curse from Agdon's scarf if she can bathe once again in her pool of replenishment. She wants to go into the pool for an hour before she will speak to the party. 

Bavlorna knows that [[Azuvira]] was last seen in [[Tither]]. The [[Hourglass Coven]] is watching her closely to see if she's a threat. So far she has made no moves. She will part with this information if the party steals a portrait from [[Skabatha Nightshade]] for her. The sisters of the [[Hourglass Coven]] do not like each other, but are also working together. While they have power, they plot against each other, but will never betray each other if it means the downfall of the coven.

Alternatively, Bavlorna will part with the information if [[Charm]] and his shadow's heist of Bavlorna's spool of thread is stopped as a part of the Rule of Reciprocity. Bavlorna will become aggressive if the party tries to steal things themselves and they are caught.

**Actions**: 
**Multiattack**. 
Bavlorna makes one Bite attack and one Withering Ray attack.

**Bite**. 
_Melee Weapon Attack:_ +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 13 (2d6 + 6) piercing damage, and the target is [grappled](https://5e.tools/conditionsdiseases.html#grappled_phb) (escape DC 17) if it is a Medium or smaller creature. Until the grapple ends, the target is [restrained](https://5e.tools/conditionsdiseases.html#restrained_phb), and Bavlorna can't use her Bite attack on another target.

**Withering Ray**. 
_Ranged Spell Attack:_ +9 to hit, range 60 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 17 (4d6 + 5) necrotic damage.

**Create Lornlings (Recharge 5–6).** 
Bavlorna creates one or two 1-foot-tall duplicates of herself, called lornlings (use the Quickling stat block in appendix C). Each lornling appears in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of Bavlorna, obeys her commands, and takes its turn immediately after hers. A lornling lasts for 1 hour, until it or Bavlorna dies, or until Bavlorna dismisses it as an action. Bavlorna can have no more than eight lornlings in existence at a time.

**Spellcasting**. 
Bavlorna casts one of the following spells, requiring no material components and using Intelligence as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 17):
-   At will: detect magic, firebolt
-   2/day each: create food and water, polymorph, remove curse
-   1/day: Plane Shift (self only), Mirror Image

**Bonus Actions**.
**Swallow**. 
Bavlorna swallows a Small or smaller creature she is grappling, ending the grapple on it. The swallowed creature is [blinded](https://5e.tools/conditionsdiseases.html#blinded_phb) and [restrained](https://5e.tools/conditionsdiseases.html#restrained_phb), it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside Bavlorna, and it takes 10 (3d6) acid damage at the start of each of its turns. If the swallowed creature is one of Bavlorna's lornlings, Bavlorna gains all the lornling's memories when the acid damage reduces it to 0 hit points.

Bavlorna can have only one creature swallowed at a time. If Bavlorna dies, a swallowed creature is no longer [restrained](https://5e.tools/conditionsdiseases.html#restrained_phb) and can escape from the corpse using 5 feet of movement, exiting [prone](https://5e.tools/conditionsdiseases.html#prone_phb).

**Legendary Actions**
Bavlorna takes 1 legendary action: a Withering Ray attack or a spell.
