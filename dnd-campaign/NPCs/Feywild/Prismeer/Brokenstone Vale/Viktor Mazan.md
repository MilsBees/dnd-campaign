# Viktor Mazan
## Description
Viktor is a 50ish year old human with greying hair in a crewcut. He's a werewolf and he is the head and founder of the lycanthrope civilization in the [[Brokenstone Vale]] within the Feywild. 

## Personality Traits
Viktor is a polite and reasonable man who has lived in the Feywild for about 20 years, though he's unaware of how long it's been considering how time works in the Feywild. For being a werewolf, he was shunned in Elanin so found solace in the Feywild. Over the years more lycanthropes found their way to the Vale, where they are free to transform without judgment.
