# Talurth
## Description
Talurth is female dragonborn werewolf with green scales and golden eyes. She has a bit of a frill on her head. She isn't very tall, standing at the same height as most humans. 

## Personality Traits
Talurth worships Tiamat and wears a large pendant with a symbol to him around her neck. She's impulsive and brusque, but loves a good brawl. Like many of the other lycanthropes, she's weary of strangers coming to [[Shatterstone]], though she's more used to outsiders than most in the settlement, as she travels to [[Walinley]] regularly to trade wares from the Feywild.
