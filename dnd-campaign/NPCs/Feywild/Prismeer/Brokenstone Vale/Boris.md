# Boris
## Description
Boris is a dwarven werebear. He has long brown hair that comes down to just above his butt. He's well over 100. He is lean and muscular with a long nose on a rounded face.

## Personality Traits
Boris scratches himself a lot and is generally a pretty solitary soul. He's shy and a bit fearful. He lives on the outskirts of [[Shatterstone]] and prefers to stay in his dwarven form. On full moons, he ventures into the woods of the [[Brokenstone Vale]] close to the portal back to the Material Plane where he's well liked by the Treants and other forest creatures who are quite protective of him. 

He's very shy and a bit cowardly, preferring to run from conflict rather than face it head on. 

If the party stopped Q from attacking Boris and saved him, he will serve as their guide to the edge of the Vale.
