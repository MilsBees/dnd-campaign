1. **Moonlit Veil.** The area becomes shrouded in an otherworldly glow. The lair becomes lightly obscured for 1 minute, and Zybilna and her allies gain advantage on Stealth checks.

3. **Feywild Sanctuary.** A patch of vibrant flowers blooms, creating a 20-foot-radius zone within 60 feet of Zybilna. This zone becomes difficult terrain for enemies, and any ally that enters the zone regains 10 hit points at the start of their turn for 1 minute.
