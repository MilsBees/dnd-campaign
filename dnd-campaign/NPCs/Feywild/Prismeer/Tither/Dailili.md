# Dailili
## Description
Dailili is a dryad. Known as the Blightweaver, Dailili is a sinister and alluring figure that stands at the nexus of decay and corrupted vitality. Her appearance is both captivating and unsettling, drawing on the remnants of the beauty that once defined her before darkness consumed her soul. Clothed in flowing robes of tattered green and gray, she seems to blend seamlessly with the withered foliage that surrounds her.

Her once-lustrous hair now hangs in lifeless strands, resembling dried vines. In contrast, her eyes shimmer with an unnatural, iridescent green, reflecting the malevolent energy that courses through her. Her gaze is both enchanting and chilling, drawing victims closer with a magnetic allure, only to ensnare them in her deadly web.

Upon her outstretched hands, thorny vines grow and twist, appearing both as a part of her and as an extension of the corrupted world she commands. With these vines, she weaves a twisted dance of death and decay, using them as both weapons and tools to drain the life force from the living.

Dailili's voice is soft and beguiling, carrying a haunting melody that hints at the time when she was a muse of nature's beauty. But beneath the honeyed words, a subtle undertone of darkness can be heard, leaving those who hear it feeling unsettled and vulnerable to her manipulations.

The scent that surrounds Dailili is a mixture of fragrant flowers and the foul odor of rot, an intoxicating blend that simultaneously lures and repels. Her presence is suffused with an aura of corruption, a testament to her mastery over the blight that has infected the once-thriving forest.

In her quest for power, Dailili has become a twisted echo of her former self, a living embodiment of the blight she spreads. Her beauty and allure act as a mask for the malevolence that lurks beneath, making her a truly formidable and enigmatic adversary for any who dare to challenge her.
Deep within the heart of the once-vibrant forest, an ominous lair emerges amidst the tangled undergrowth. Dailili, the Blightweaver, has claimed this place as her own, using it as a conduit to channel the stolen essence of nature's vitality. The air is thick with a pungent scent of decay, and a haunting silence grips the surroundings, broken only by the creaking of withered trees and the distant, eerie cries of creatures affected by the dark magic that festers here.

## Personality Traits
Dailili is vengeful and especially hates the Material Plane and everyone on it. 

## Background 
Dailili is a newly risen archfey that has come to power in the wake of the capture of [[Zybilna]]. When the witches of the [[Hourglass Coven]] captured Zybilna, they were unaware that Zybilna's magic was keeping Dailili from gaining strength.

She regains 30 hit points, and any withered plants in the lair begin to rejuvenate, blooming with unnatural, sickly flowers that exude an aura of malevolence. Creatures within 60 feet of Dailili during this action must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for 1 minute.
