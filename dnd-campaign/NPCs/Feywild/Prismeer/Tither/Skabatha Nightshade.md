# Skabatha Nightshade

## Description

Skabatha Nightshade is a capricious Fey creature with an ever-changing appearance. She possesses an air of enchantment, her form shifting between ethereal and solid, and her features transforming with each passing moment. Her eyes sparkle with mischief, and her laughter carries a hint of danger. She has a key on her back that turns slower and slower as she gets angrier. When it's completely still, she will lash out in anger. 

## Personality Traits

Skabatha delights in deception and manipulation, finding pleasure in toying with the lives and perceptions of others. She is capricious and quick to anger, but her ever-changing nature makes it difficult to predict her next move. Skabatha revels in chaos and enjoys using her shapeshifting abilities to confound her enemies and allies alike. She is drawn to power and is willing to form alliances of convenience to further her own agenda.
