The Getaway Gang is a group of children led by [[Will of the Feywild]] that seeks to free the children held captive by [[Skabatha Nightshade]].

Besides Will, the gang is made up of:

Bobi: a boisterous male dwarf growing the beginnings of his beard
Sloane: a sarcastic, ginger-haired female wood elf
Zennor: a tenacious female orc

All three use the commoners stat block and appear to be 8 years old.
