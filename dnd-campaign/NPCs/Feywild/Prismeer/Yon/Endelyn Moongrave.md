**Actions**: 
**Multiattack**. 
Bavlorna makes one Bite attack and one Withering Ray attack.

**Bite**. 
_Melee Weapon Attack:_ +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 13 (2d6 + 6) piercing damage, and the target is [grappled](https://5e.tools/conditionsdiseases.html#grappled_phb) (escape DC 17) if it is a Medium or smaller creature. Until the grapple ends, the target is [restrained](https://5e.tools/conditionsdiseases.html#restrained_phb), and Bavlorna can't use her Bite attack on another target.

**Withering Ray**. 
_Ranged Spell Attack:_ +7 to hit, range 60 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 17 (4d6 + 3) necrotic damage.

**Create Lornlings (Recharge 5–6).** 
Bavlorna creates one or two 1-foot-tall duplicates of herself, called lornlings (use the Quickling stat block in appendix C). Each lornling appears in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of Bavlorna, obeys her commands, and takes its turn immediately after hers. A lornling lasts for 1 hour, until it or Bavlorna dies, or until Bavlorna dismisses it as an action. Bavlorna can have no more than eight lornlings in existence at a time.

**Spellcasting**. 
Bavlorna casts one of the following spells, requiring no material components and using Intelligence as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 15):
-   At will: detect magic, firebolt
-   2/day each: create food and water, polymorph, remove curse
-   1/day: Plane Shift (self only), Mirror Image

**Bonus Actions**.
**Swallow**. 
Bavlorna swallows a Small or smaller creature she is grappling, ending the grapple on it. The swallowed creature is [blinded](https://5e.tools/conditionsdiseases.html#blinded_phb) and [restrained](https://5e.tools/conditionsdiseases.html#restrained_phb), it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside Bavlorna, and it takes 10 (3d6) acid damage at the start of each of its turns. If the swallowed creature is one of Bavlorna's lornlings, Bavlorna gains all the lornling's memories when the acid damage reduces it to 0 hit points.

Bavlorna can have only one creature swallowed at a time. If Bavlorna dies, a swallowed creature is no longer [restrained](https://5e.tools/conditionsdiseases.html#restrained_phb) and can escape from the corpse using 5 feet of movement, exiting [prone](https://5e.tools/conditionsdiseases.html#prone_phb).

**Legendary Actions**
Bavlorna takes 1 legendary action: a Withering Ray attack.
