# Sir Talavar
## Description
Sir Talavar is a purple faerie dragon carrying a tiny sword that's strapped to a belt around his waist. 

## Personality Traits
Sir Talavar is a loyal vassal of the Summer Queen of the [[Seelie Court]]. He has an upbeat demeanor and is a strict observer of noble etiquette and courtesies. He knows the way to [[Downfall]], where the party can find [[Bavlorna Blightstraw]]. He wants to be set free from his cage because he needs to report to the Summer Queen that [[Zybilna]] has been captured by the witches of the [[Hourglass Coven]]. If the party frees him, he rewards them with his sword.

**Euphoria Breath (Recharge 5–6)**. 
Sir Talavar exhales a puff of euphoria gas at one creature within 5 feet of him. The target must succeed on a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw, or for 1 minute, the target can't take reactions and must roll a d6 at the start of each of its turns to determine its behaviour during the turn:
-   1-4. The target takes no action or bonus action and uses all of its movement to move in a random direction.
-   5-6. The target doesn't move, and the only thing it can do on its turn is make a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.
