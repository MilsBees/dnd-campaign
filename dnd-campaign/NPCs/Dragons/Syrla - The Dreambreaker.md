## Dream Sequences for [[George]]
As George succumbs to sleep, his consciousness plunges into a realm of darkness and whispers. He finds himself standing on the precipice of a bottomless abyss, surrounded by an eerie silence. The air is thick with a sense of foreboding, and a chilling wind whistles through the void.

Suddenly, the darkness shifts and you see a form appear superimposed on the darkness. An even darker form, if that's possible. Within that darkness though, you see two maliciously gleaming red eyes Her voice echoes through your mind, tinged with a mix of enchantment and manipulation.

"Oh good, a new pawn. Hopefully you're not so WEAK as the last one." Syrla's voice slithers into his thoughts, her tone dripping with a blend of honeyed persuasion and veiled threats. "You stumbled upon my essence, and now you shall help me achieve my ascendance."

The dream takes a twisted turn as shadowy forms materialize around George, morphing into grotesque nightmares. Fear grips your heart as the voice grows more persuasive, planting images of dominance and devastation in your mind. You see kingdoms in ruins, innocent lives trampled underfoot, and the world engulfed in flames.

"I am Syrla, and you are mine." Syrla's voice continues, her words dripping with selfish intent. "Embrace the power of the Orb. It can bring you great things. I will ascend to godhood, and you shall bask in the spoils of my triumph."

Syrla stops short suddenly, as a chilling presence slithers into your consciousness. A second voice enters your mind, one you recognize.

"Oooh, company, what fun!," your patron's voice intertwines with the shadows, oozing with devious charm. "Syrla please, enough with the empty promises. The Orb possess great power, this is true. It will help us achieve all we seek to. This creature here is just a distraction." Syrla snarls and the shadow unleashes a fiery inferno that is its breath weapon. It engulfs you as your patron's sinister laughter echoes through your mind and you find yourself sweating and tangled in your bed roll. 

Fear, uncertainty, and a sense of your own vulnerability confronts you. Around you, the trees seem to have shifted in your sleep and hang closer and lower to you, the shadows longer and colder. The sky, peeking through the trees also seems darker, a deep navy pulsing with crimson. As you come to your senses and shake off the dream state these effects fade a bit and now you aren't sure if you were still dreaming or if this is just Feywild things.
