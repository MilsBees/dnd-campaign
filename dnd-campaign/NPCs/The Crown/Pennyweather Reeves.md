# Pennyweather Reeves
## Description
Pennyweather is tall silver skinned half-elf with chestnut brown hair, usually kept in a long braid. She's always carrying her bow and is an excellent shot, which she's augmented with the use of magic over the years, learning from [[Raszu]] and secretly from [[Koren Helder]] over the years to make her Elanin's premier marksperson. 
  
## Personality Traits
Pennyweather is determined and strong willed. She's very loyal to Albin but is clever enough to work independently and make her own judgments. 

## Background
Pennyweather was born in [[Mardomar]] as the daughter of a drow father and a human mother. Her father abandoned her at an early age so her mother took her back to [[Elanin]]. As a result, she loathes drow and Mardomar in particular.

Pennyweather was a regular guard of the castle under [[King Zeimar]]'s rule.  When [[Benji]] took the throne as regent, [[Albin 'Morningstar' Jones]] took her under his wing and promoted her to the unofficial title of Queen's Guard member. The two of them and [[Wallace DeGrey]] made up the Queen's Guard and ensured that [[Queen Daelia|Daelia]] was kept safe. They watched over her as she grew up and ensured there were allies for a time when she could regain the throne. 

Now that Benji is dead and Daelia has taken the throne, the Queen's Guard has become official and she is Albin's right hand woman.

### DM Notes
Now that [[Queen Daelia]] is on the throne, Pennyweather is looking ahead to an incoming war with [[Mardomar]]. This is where she differs greatly from Albin who is trying to prevent this at all costs. She has secretly collaborated with the four generals of the Army, in particular [[Artus Dickory]] to ensure a war happens.
