# Zutosk
## Description
Zutosk is an older lizardfolk with sharp, pointed features and dark brown eyes. Unlike many of the lizardfolk soldiers you've encountered so far, he's got scales that are still a brighter green, not dulled from battle. 

## Personality Traits
Zutosk is very afraid and mistrustful of [[Irlax]]. Where the Queen and the head Shaman (named Garurt) worshipped [[Irlax]], Zutosk is looking for an opportunity to get rid of [[Irlax]], and he secretly wants to become the head Shaman and defacto leader, though he knows he's not physically strong enough to become the new King or Queen. 

Zutosk will leap at the opportunity to change his fate as the lesser Shaman. Any charisma check made to convince him will have a DC of 12. That being said, he's afraid of the wrath of [[Irlax]], so will be wary of any plot to cross him, even though he very much wants to escape [[Irlax]]'s control. 

If the party makes clear they want to face the dragon, Zutosk will not participate, but he will highly recommend they get help.
