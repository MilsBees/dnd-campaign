# Cheyakre
## Description
Cheyakre is an elderly lizardfolk with a plated head and blue eyes. Her scales are rugged and have discolored to brown with her age, but she's very tall and beefy.  

## Personality Traits
Cheyakre is the caretaker of the children in the village together with her partner [[Krux]]. She is very optimistic that [[Irlax]] will protect the village from any harm and is of the belief that Lizardfolk communities can only truly thrive under the guidance of a dragon. She's very excited that she'll finally get to enjoy this in her lifetime, as she'd previously only ever heard of Lizardfolk communities protected by dragons.

Cheyakre is stern with the children and all but the most devious listen to her out of fear and respect. She controls her partner in much the same way.
