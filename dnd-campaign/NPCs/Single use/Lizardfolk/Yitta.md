# Yitta
## Description
Yitta is a young lizardfolk with a smooth head and gray eyes. He has black scales and is quite short. He's got webbed hands, which makes him very clumsy. 

## Personality Traits
Yitta worships [[Irlax]] and is very excited about the prospect of having a dragon protect their village. Until now it was only ever something he'd heard about from his parents as a legend. 

He hasn't seen [[Irlax]] yet and is secretly afraid to, but is also very curious and hopes he's chosen later as one of the young lizardfolk chosen to bring the gifts to [[Irlax]].
