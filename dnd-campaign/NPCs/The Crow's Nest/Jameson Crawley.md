# Jameson Crawley
## Description
Jameson is a sandy haired, slightly overweight man in his late 30s.
  
## Personality Traits
Jameson speaks in a slightly higher voice and is generally quite upbeat, when he isn't drunk, which isn't often. He knows the area well enough to make the journey from [[Walinley]] to the safehouse, but is very wary of any danger and avoids it where possible. 

## Background
Jameson has a steady if boring job for [[The Crow's Nest]]. He spends most of his time drinking, except when he needs to make the trek to the safehouse.

Jameson joined [[Ruin]] into the marshes and brought them to the [[Walinley#The Crow's Nest Crow's Nest safehouse|safehouse]]. When the party trekked further into marsh to the Lizardfolk town, Jameson stayed behind at the safehouse.
