# Shorse encounter
## Overview
If the party ever gets lost in the Feywild, they can encounter a shepherd named [[Urt]]. Urt needs to make sure all his shorses are accounted for and asks the party for help. He offers them a map of the Feywild (this doesn't actually exist because there is no mapping the Feywild, which the party can realize with a DC 15 Insight check) if they help him. The shorses need to jump from one pasture into another one over a small fence. 

Counting the shorses will induce sleep if they don't succeed a WIS Saving Throw 16. If they fall asleep, Urt and his son [[Rydel]] will steal their gold (not their silver or platinum). If they're caught trying to do this, they'll offer the party shorses instead. DC 13 Animal Handling to control them.
