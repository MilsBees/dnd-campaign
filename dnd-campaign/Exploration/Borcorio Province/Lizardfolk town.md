# Overview
[[Ruin]] found this Lizardfolk outpost on a quest for [[Vetrix Lesana]], as they set out to investigate why one of The Crow's safehouses in the swamp on the outskirts of [[Walinley]] had gone dark. They have settled in the remains of an old military outpost of some kind, long since abandoned. The various structures that remain have been reused to gain a new purpose. In other cases, tents have been set up from patchwork leather. 

The perimeter of the village holds a mixture of palisades that have stood the test of time, mixed in with wooden stakes that have been pummelled into the ground to warn off intruders. On the eastern side of the village, the swamp meets a hillside, which creates a natural barrier into the village. On the north side of the village, a path out of the village leads to the lair of [[Irlax]] (see [[Irlax lair entrance.jpeg]]).

## Buildings
### Outpost
The building is an old wooden outpost. There is a tower structure to it from where there is a decent overview of any lizardfolk returning from the warehouse or any trespassers, though the wild growth of plants and the fog stemming from the presence of [[Irlax]] has made this more difficult recently. 

### Breeding hut
One of the larger tents in the village, surrounded by many smaller tents which are presumably homes. Entering, you immediately notice the heat. Strewn across the floor throughout the tent are burning embers and on one side of the tent you see a firepit (presumably the source of the burning embers on the floor). The floor, where you can see it, is black with soot. Sitting on top of these embers are hundreds of eggs of various sizes. The eggs are a light red with darker red veins spread across it and if felt, they feel softer and more flexible than they look. Towards the middle of the circle, the eggs grow larger until the very centre, where the biggest egg sits perched on its own circle of glowing embers. 

### Childcare home
Next to the breeding hut on the edge of the tree line are the remains of the old military outpost. It's a half collapsed wooden structure, supplemented with some of the lizardfolk leathers hammered into it, to create a tented frontside with a wooden back. From the tent you can hear (if you speak Draconic) high pitched children's voices yelling and playing, with the occasional adult voice chiming in. For those not understanding Draconic, you just hear elevated, higher pitched but still guttural speech. 

Inside, there are a multitude of young lizardfolk running around and playing. There are also two elderly lizardfolk sitting on stools in the back, overlooking everything. 

### Kitchen
On the far side of the village, the smell of cooking meats fills your nostrils as you happen upon another older wooden structure from the original village. This smaller building is still mostly intact, a one story building which based on its location in the village, was likely a storage facility of some kind. Outside you see a firepit with a spit over it, roasting several small to medium sized rodents. 

A portly older lizardfolk is tending to the spit, walking over to another cauldron holding a stew of some kind on another fire nearby. He shouts into the building every once in a while and a younger lizardfolk comes running out, bringing out more food to add to the stew. 

### Barracks
Whilst most of the villages building are a ways off of the outpost building, the barracks connects the two areas. This structure is a partially ruined old wooden structure from the original outpost, with holes in the roof patched with leathers. There are seven lizardfolk warriors inside. Four are sitting around a table eating some dried meats. Two are sparring a little with their spears whilst the third watches on.
