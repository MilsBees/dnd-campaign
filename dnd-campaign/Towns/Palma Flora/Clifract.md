# Overview

Clifract is a seaside town on Palma Flora. It's the only real town on the island, and is closely connected to the mainland city of [[Gramodeen]]. It's warm and balmy, particularly early in the morning. The town's folk are wary of [[Three Earrings]], though they're warm and friendly to newcomers in general. 

The town is split over several small isles, the two biggest of which are called Tisris and Cadena.

## Notable places
## Grimalda's Scrolls
This is a small scrollery that sells magic scrolls. It's a store filled mostly with old dusty books and trinkets that aren't worth much. The store is also her living room. She has mostly 1st level spell scrolls and a few more expensive ones. The first level spells she has are scrolls for magic missile, shield, guiding bolt and thunderwave. They cost 50 gp each. 

The store can be found in the small island Tisris next to the keep. 

## Generally George
This is a small general goods store that sells general adventuring gear under 50gp. Of each item, he has only 2 or 3 depending on the item. Selling for half price is also possible here. [[George Krin]], who runs the store, also sells 2 potions of healing. This store can be found on the main island Cadena.

## The Short Harbour
The Short Harbour is Clifract's tavern and inn, situated on the isle of Cadena close to the port. It's run by a female dwarf called [[Gisida]]. As Clifract sees many tourists, the rooms are quite expensive at 1gp per night. 

The Short Harbour can be found on Cadena.
