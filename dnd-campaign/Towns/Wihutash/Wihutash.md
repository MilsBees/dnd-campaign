## Notable places
### Wihutash Library 
The Wihutash Library is a famous library not for its size, but for its selection. It has a lot of ancient texts and first edition books from Elanin's ancient history. Most notably it has a series of  books for children called the 'Tales of Elanin'. Reading one of these stories puts one in a trance. Looking up from one of the books after reading it is an entrance to the [[Feywild Entrances|Feywild]].
