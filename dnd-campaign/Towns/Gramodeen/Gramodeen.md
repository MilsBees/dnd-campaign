# Overview

Gramodeen is port town on the mainland of [[Elanin]], across the sea from [[Clifract]] on the island of Palma Flora. The town is muddy and rain-slicked most of the time, though it sees its fair share of travellers as it's the best way to get to Palma Flora, the popular holiday destination. 

It can feel quite busy here with all the people. It's a large city with city walls forming almost a star shape as they form the borders to the town. Outside the town there's a bridge that crosses over to Palma Flora and [[Clifract]].

## Potions and co.
The town's apothecary is located in the center of town, not too far from port. It's run by [[Aldageam]], a sea elf druid. She's a friend of [[Three Earrings]] and will thus sell 10 potions of water breathing at a reduced price of 40gp each.

## Let's Get Thrifty
The town's thriving pawn shop, found right next door to Potions and co. is owned by an older gentleman named [[Grick]]. Items sold here fetch 75% of their original value, rather than the traditional 50%. 

## Kira Unity outpost
On the south side of town, near the port sits an outpost for the Kira Unity.
