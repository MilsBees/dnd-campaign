# Overview

Shatterstone is a lycanthrope settlement in the [[Brokenstone Vale]] of the Feywild. Not much more than a trading post, there are scattered houses around and the beginning's of a keep which doesn't look like it's been worked on anymore.

When it isn't a full moon, most walk about in human or hybrid form, though there is a divide between the two, with the humans staying at the edges of the settlement.

## Notable places
## Bane's Keep (1)
Bane's Keep is a small keep that's still being built. [[Viktor Mazan]] lives here alongside some of his trusted companions. The entry hall is being used as makeshift tavern. It looks a lot like Kaer Morhen from the Witcher. 

## Boris' Home (2)
[[Boris]] keeps mostly to himself on the outskirts of town, close to the river. From there he can make his way easily to the woods to transform without having to face the rest of the lycanthropes.

## Notable inhabitants
- [[Viktor Mazan]] - leader of Shatterstone
- [[Talurth]] - female dragonborn trader
