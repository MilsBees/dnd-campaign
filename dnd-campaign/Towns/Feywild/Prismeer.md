# Overview

Prismeer is a land in the Feywild that is split into three parts, [[Hither]], [[Tither]] and [[Yon]]. 

## Current situation
The archfey presiding over the land, [[Zybilna]], has been captured by [[Bavlorna Blightstraw]], [[Endelyn Moongrave]] and [[Skabatha Nightshade]] of the [[Hourglass Coven]]. Unbeknownst to them, the capture of [[Zybilna]] has released [[Dailili]] from her magical prison and she has been quickly rising to power, with thoughts of spreading her roots to the Material Plane as revenge for once being banished from there.
